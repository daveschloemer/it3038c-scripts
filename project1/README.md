# Project 1

This is David Schloemer's first project

This project was written to find three keywords in a massive text file. The three words are Cherry, Peach,
and Apple. All three are hidden throughout the text making it impossible to find all of them. This program
will sort and show each line where those three keywords are. I wrote this code entirely on my own.
