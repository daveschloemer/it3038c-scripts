Welcome to David Schloemer's Lab 7. This Lab is a current Weather viewer for PowerShell. It will allow you to view the weather in three different units. Metric, Kelvin, and Imperal. 

To get started, all you need to do is download the OpenWeatherMap Module. To do this:
1: Open PowerShell
2: Type in Install-Module OpenWeatherMap

Now that you have the OpenWeatherMap Module installed, you are free to run the program! This PowerShell Program uses an API key, and it is my personal key. If you want to use your own key, you'll need to create an account at openweathermap.org. Once you create your account, just change the API key to yours. For now we will use mine

To get started running this program, open powershell and change the directory to where the program is stored. Use CD to change the directory
Then type in .\Lab7PSFile
After the program starts, it'll ask you what unit you want to see your weather in. Press 1 for imperal. Press 2 for Kelvin. Press 3 for Metric
Once you do that, it'll ask you to type in your city. Choose any city you like! I chose San Francisco!
It will then output the weather of that city you typed in!

Enjoy! This code was written entirely on my own
