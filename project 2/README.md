Welcome to David Schloemer's Project 2! This project is pretty similar to my Project 1. This Project has the same idea as Project 1, except it takes it a step further. In my
previous project, I created a word filter that only filtered out three words. Cherry, Apple, and Peach. Well I thought it might be better if I could prompt the user what word they
would like to find instead of being limited to three words. This program now prompts the user what kind of word they are searching for. If you want to try it, go ahead and type in
Peach, Apple, or Cherry. I also added my name in, so you can also type in David as well. I also took it a step further, and prompt the user for the location. This now means that
you can have this filter read your own text file!

To get started, run the program by typing in powershell ./wordfilter.ps1. 

I encourage you to use your own text file but you are welcome to use mine!

2) Type in the location of the text file

3) Then type in either David, Apple, Peach, or Cherry. If you know Lorem, you could also search for that as bit nicer by spreading them out into nice lines.

This project was written entirely on my own, but I also got help from people as well.

Enjoy!
