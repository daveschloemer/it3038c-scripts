Welcome to David Schloemer's Final Project! This project is pretty similar to both of my first two projects. This project adds the finishing touches to my Google 4 Files Program.

This project will allow you to search for a word in any given text file, and find it almost immediately. You will also have an option to save the output to another text file, or you can 
just review the results in the PowerShell Window. 

A tool like this might be very important when it comes to searching huge text files, and saving a copy of where you found that word may be very beneficial in the long run!


To get started, run the program by typing in powershell ./Google4Files.ps1.

I encourage you to use your own text file but you are welcome to use mine!

Type in the location of the text file

Then type in either David, Apple, Peach, or Cherry. If you know Lorem, you could also search for that as well!

The results look very nice and are easily spaced out!

This project was written entirely on my own, but I also got help from people as well.

Enjoy!

David Schloemer
